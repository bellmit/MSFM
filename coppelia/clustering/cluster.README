extracting
--------------

To extract the contents into the current
directory use the following command

  tar xvf cluster.tar

To extract the contents as root use the
following comand

  tar xovf cluster.tar


setup
-------------
In order for the scripts to run properly, you have to do
the following:

1) The scripts has to be modified with the correct parameters
   before they can be run.

   ./etc/init.d/nicfailover is used for failing over
   a primary nic card with a standby nic card.

   The scripts currently comes with these parameters

   MASTER_NIC=hme0
   SECONDARDY_NIC=hme1
   LOGICAL_IP=192.168.129.30
   WELL_KNOWN_IP=192.168.129.27 


   ./etc/init.d/cluster does the same as nicfailover. In addition,
2) it will setup the correct logical IP for Coppelia HA on the FIX
   side of the connection.

   The script currently comes with these parameters

   NIC_DEV1=hme0
   NIC_DEV2=hme1
   NIC_LOGICAL_IP=192.168.129.30
   WELL_KNOWN_IP=192.168.129.27
   LOGICAL_IP=192.168.129.213
   COPPELIA_FIX_PORT=10055        


3) You then have to move or copy the files so that that the
   reside off the root directory.

   By default these scripts will running automatically when booting.
   If you want to disable them, just remove the symbolic link from
   the /etc/rc2.d directory. To reenable them, recreate the symbolic
   link in the /etc/rc2.d directory.
