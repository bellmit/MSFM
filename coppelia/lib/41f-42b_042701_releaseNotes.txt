    Title:  Socket disconnect problem
Developer:  Benjamin Lai 
     Date:  19th April 2001
     
Statement
---------
SocketDisconnect now takes ConnectionData instead of just socket this will make it 
more reliable since it won't have to lookup the cd.  This avoids the problem of the 
socket being set to null in CD before it is in the disconnect state which results in
a permanent loop.

This was why the backup server also had problem on failover.  Becuase the state was
UP but the socket was set to null so when SocketDisconnect was called it never found
the CD and therefore could never mark it down.

    Title:  DBServer resync all records on connection to a new server
Developer:  Benjamin Lai
     Date:  3rd April 2001
     
Statement
---------

DBserver would get duplicate messages whenever it disconnected from one primary server
and reconnected.  This was due to the fact the the syncEndSeqNumber_ was only updated
on startup.  Before the DBServer reconnects to a server it updates the syncEndSeqNumber_


Description Of Changes
----------------------

added a new message UPDATE_SYNC_DATA and a new method updateSyncData in
PersistentStats
