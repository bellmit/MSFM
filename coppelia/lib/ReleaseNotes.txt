    Title:  Socket disconnect problem
Developer:  Benjamin Lai 
     Date:  19th April 2001
     
Statement
---------
SocketDisconnect now takes ConnectionData instead of just socket this will make it 
more reliable since it won't have to lookup the cd.  This avoids the problem of the 
socket being set to null in CD before it is in the disconnect state which results in
a permanent loop.

This was why the backup server also had problem on failover.  Becuase the state was
UP but the socket was set to null so when SocketDisconnect was called it never found
the CD and therefore could never mark it down.


Description Of Changes
----------------------

CommStuff:SocketDisconnect now takes ConnectionData

    Title: Empry tag in fix messages causes a reject
Developer: Benjamin Lai
     Date:  17th April 2001
     
Statement
---------

Fixed a bug in Coppelia where messages with empty tags were being swallowed they
now force a reject message.

    Title: HeartBeat retry for HA Server
Developer: Benjamin Lai
     Date: 17th April 2001
     
Statement
---------

added the HEARTBEAT_RETRIES which defines the number of time a backup server 
will try to HB the primary before it fails over

    Title:  DBServer resync all records on connection to a new server
Developer:  Benjamin Lai
     Date:  3rd April 2001
     
Statement
---------

DBserver would get duplicate messages whenever it disconnected from one primary server
and reconnected.  This was due to the fact the the syncEndSeqNumber_ was only updated
on startup.  Before the DBServer reconnects to a server it updates the syncEndSeqNumber_


Description Of Changes
----------------------

added a new message UPDATE_SYNC_DATA and a new method updateSyncData in
PersistentStats

Resolution
----------

Example
-------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    Title: Fixed overrun of resend request n to 999999
Developer: Benjamin Lai
     Date: 2/28/2001
     
Statement
---------
Orinally end was to by:

        rm.end = cd_.getMsgSequenceNumOut();
        
The problem was that cd_.getMsgSequenceNumOut() didn't exists yet



Description Of Changes
----------------------

we now set:
        rm.end = cd_.getMsgSequenceNumOut() -1;



Resolution

Example

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title: local_ip fix for HA
Developer: Benjamin Lai 
     Date: 2/9/2001
     
Statement
---------
When the CoppeliaHA initiates a connection it use to use the real ip address 
when creating the socket which caused it to be disconnected from remote sites
becuase the setup the virtual ip and had ip_checking set to on.


Description Of Changes
----------------------
Added the attribute "local_ip" in the main block so that they can now set the 
ip address of the outbound socket.


Resolution
----------

Example
-------

[MAIN]
local_ip = 127.0.0.1


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title: Updated HA initialization process
Developer: Benjmain Lai 
     Date: 9/2/2001
     
Statement
---------
Becuase some thread wern't exiting on backup server disconnect I modified the
order of the cleanup and exit routine of the processing threads for the client

Alive - the status of the thread
Daemon - Daemon thread

We still need to name all of our threads correctly

8   true   false  Thread-5
9   true   false  Thread-6
