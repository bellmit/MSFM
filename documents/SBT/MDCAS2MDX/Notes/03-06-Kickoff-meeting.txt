Meeting: Initial Kickoff
Attendees: Tom, Emily, Arun and Wayne
Issues and concerns:
1. Should we combine the functionality into the existing MDX process or have two separate processes? 
We will have only one process to reduce INFRA work load in configurations.

2. During rollout, how could we handle double publishing from MDCAS and MDX?
The concern is based on the assumption that MDCAS and MDX could have many-to-many relationship in configuration. Tom pointed out that in production MDCAS has one-to-many mapping with MDX, so we could turn one MDCAS OFF and many MDX boxes ON at once during the rollout.

3. Could the firms subscribing EOP/EOS from MDCAS have issues to access MDX through firewalls?
We need to inform these firms if they have not subscribed data from MDX.

4. Code changes:
MDCAS subscribes market data based on class keys. MDX subscribes with its group 
keys. We need to have code modification on MDX to subscribe eop/eos/ltls on its group keys.

Action items:
1. We need to verify the production configuration between MDCAS and MDX to see if there is any overwrites - Wayne.

2. We need to find the firms subscribing eop/eos data from MDCAS but no subscribing to MDX - Wayne.

3. Test 7 will be the development environment. We need to install CAS with v6.8 and MDX with latest par2mdx label - Arun.

4. We will have design/code review on par2mdx code - Arun and Wayne.
