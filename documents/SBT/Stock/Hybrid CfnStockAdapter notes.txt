Notes:
--------

 CFN Build and Release Dependancy
   - There is new IDL from cfn for NASDAQ handling.  Need to have the LATEST from cfnstock_1.0_nasdaq.  This branch contain the cfnStockIDL.idl and cfnStockIDL.jar


 New Channel names:
    - These are listed in the Impl plan.  But they are: CfnStockService and CfnStockAdmin.  The createSbtEC has amended to create these channels


 Enabling StockHybrid:
    - In the StockCFNTradeConsumer.xml and StockCFNQuoteConsumer.xml  

       <enableHybridReporting booleanValue="true"/>
       <siacReportingExchanges>NYSE,CBOE</siacReportingExchanges>  
           + This property is used to determine wether the Qt/TR reports are sent to SIAC or NASDAQ.  The list is the primary exchanges.  If the primary exchange for a prod class is in the list then sent to SIAC if NOT in the list then sent to NASDAQ.
